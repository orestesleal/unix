# Some small C utilities I coded a few months/years ago

- tlp.c         A sort of software teleprompter
- calc.c        Utility for calculating internet usage on dial-up lines
                I wrote this several years ago to count how much internet
                I used back then
- ls.c          A small as possible ls(1) implementation
